# Image_Segmentation-for-Disaster-Resilience
Image Segmentation for Disaster Resilience is a deep learning project developed for the FloodNet Challenge, focused on leveraging semantic segmentation to assist in flood impact analysis. Using a U-Net architecture, the model segments aerial imagery to detect key features such as flooded buildings, roads, water bodies, vegetation, and more.
